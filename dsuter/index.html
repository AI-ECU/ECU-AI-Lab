	I am currently a Research Professor in AI at <a href="https://www.ecu.edu.au">Edith Cowan University</a>, 
	Perth, Western Australia.</p>
		I was a Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au">University of Adelaide</a> from 2008-2017. 
	For some years I was also Head of School of Computer Science there.
		Prior to that (1992-2008) I held various positions at <a href="https://www.monash.edu.au">Monash University</a> 
	including Professor and Associate Dean Research (Faculty of Engineering) </p>
My first appointment was a Lecturer at <a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au">La Trobe University</a> But that was so.....last century! <p>
I was (until March 2021) an associate editor for the journal <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition">Pattern Recognition</a>
and I am a member of the Honourary Editorial Board of <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11263">Int. J. of Computer Vision</a>.<p>
